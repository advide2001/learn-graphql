## Learning outcomes

1. numbered list with TLBAT-type formatting

## What will we be building?

We will be building a realtime todo app using authenticated GraphQL APIs.

Try this deployed version of the app to see what we'll be building: https://learn-hasura-todo-app.netlify.com/

## Will this course teach Next.js concepts as well?

No, we will be simulating a scenario where we already have a GraphQL API and the basic UI of a Next.js app built. Our
task in this scenario is to integrate the GraphQL APIs into our Next.js app to build a complete and working app.

If you're new to Hooks in React, we recommend going through the
[official docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and then coming back here!
