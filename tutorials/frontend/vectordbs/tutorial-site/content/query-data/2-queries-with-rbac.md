# Remote joins with Access Control
Let us now define permissions on our data. Our current usecase has user profile of `Hiring Manager` and hiring managers should be able to review only the resumes that are tagged to them.

We can do this easily by defining `SELECT` permission on our `hiring_manager` relationship. You can copy and paste this rule into the first line of the editor, or configure it using the dropdown GUI.

```
{"application_relationship":{"hiring_manager":{"_eq":"x-hasura-manager-id"}}}
```

Adding this rule does the magic! We'll now only see the applications belonging to the manager id in x-hasura-manager-id ðŸŽ‰

Donâ€™t forget to send x-hasura-role as manager and x-hasura-manager-id as your id of choice:
