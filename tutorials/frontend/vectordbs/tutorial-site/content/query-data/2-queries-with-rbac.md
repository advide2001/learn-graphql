Hasura has a robust [permissions system](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/auth/authorization/index/) that allows for
granular authorization. We'll use this system to define permissions on the data we just imported. As our application is
meant to be a helpful tool for HR managers, it would make sense for a user to only see information relevant to them.

We can do this easily by defining `SELECT` permission on our `hiring_manager` relationship. Head to the `Data` tab and
click on the `Resume` table of the `Resumes` database. Then, click the `Permissions` tab, create a role named `manager`
and choose `SELECT` as shown in the screenshot below. You can copy and paste this rule into the first line of the
editor, or configure it using the dropdown GUI.

```
{"application_relationship":{"hiring_manager":{"_eq":"x-hasura-manager-id"}}}
```

Adding this rule does the magic! If we head back to the Console and run a query with the `x-hasura-manager-id` header
added, and assign it to a specific manager, we'll now only see the applications belonging to the manager's `id` in
`x-hasura-manager-id` ðŸŽ‰
